    <h1 style="color:aqua;">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Steffi. I was named after the tennis player Steffi Graf. I have had quite a few harsh and unexpected life experiences. These experiences make me a more resilient and patient person. </p>
    <img src="assets/images/IMG_1842.jpg" alt="Snow Picture">
    <p>Originally I was born in Kokomo, Indiana. Soon after I was born my parents divorced and my mother, sister, brother and I moved to Santa Barbara, California. I lived on and off at my grandmother's orchard until I was 10 at which point, my grandmother's
        livelihood went down the creek and my grandmother relocated us to Tucson, Arizona. I had been homeless, poverty stricken, lost everything I had, and struggled with a great many things living in California. I have resided in Tucson ever since.
        Life did not get easier for me there.</p>
    <p>I attended a middle school/highschool here in Tucson called Sonoran Science Academy. A small school where my graduating class was the largest the school had ever seen at a whopping 60 students. I met my husband in middle school. We have been together
        for 6 years now and have a 4 year old son.</p>
    <p>I attended the University of Arizona studying Veterinary Science and Biomedical Engineering until I became pregnant with my son. I have attended Pima Community College since then and I am close to an Associates degree and Bachelors degree at this
        point. My life's goal is to be a Veterinarian.</p>
    <p>My work experience begins at the age of 11 in the field of scientific research. I have worked at the U of A Animal Sciences Department, U of A Systematic Bioengineering Laboratory, Petsmart, Ace Hardware, Bed Bath and Beyond, Personal Assistant to
        a Pet Psychic, Chocolateer, Safeway, Amazon, and Rev. Currently I work for MiTek Sales Simplicity Homebuilder Software and I have been Assistant Chef to Personal Chef Maggie for eight years.</p>
